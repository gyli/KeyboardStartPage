# Keyboard Start Page

This is an alternative start page for Chrome. It will replace the new tab page that you can set up the shortcuts for favorite websites.

On the page there's only a virtual keyboard and you can set each key to the link you want. By pressing down the keyboard, no matter the virtual one or physical one, you can jump to your favorite website as you set.

## Installation

Download this extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyboard-start-page/lcgabkjfibeakijbhicjjilchhmjaiid).

## Tips

* Open link in a new tab by pressing Shift+\<Key\> or middle clicking.
* The cursor always starts from URL bar for every new tab due to the limit of broswer. Press \<Tab\> twice or click the page to focus on the page if you want to use the shortcuts after opening a new tab.
