# Keyboard Start Page

This is an alternative start page for Chrome. It will replace the new tab page that you can set up the shortcuts for favorite websites.

On the page there's only a virtual keyboard and you can set each key to the link you want. By pressing down the keyboard, no matter the virtual one or physical one, you can jump to your favorite website as you set.


## Tips

* Open link in a new tab by pressing Shift+<Key> or middle clicking.
