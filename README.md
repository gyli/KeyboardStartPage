# Keyboard Start Page
This is an alternative start page for Chrome. It will replace the new tab page that you can set up the shortcuts for favorite websites.

On the page there's only a virtual keyboard and you can set each key to the link you want. By pressing down the keyboard, no matter the virtual one or physical one, you can jump to your favorite website as you setted.

## Installation
Download this extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyboard-start-page/lcgabkjfibeakijbhicjjilchhmjaiid).

## Shortcut Table
All the shortcuts with clicking follow the [native shortcuts in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179), while for pure keyboard shortcuts, **Ctrl** is replaced by **Alt** and **⌘** is replaced by **⌥** to avoid conflict.

|Windows/Linux|Mac|Default Actions|
|---|---|---|
|**\<Key\>** or left click a key|**\<Key\>** or left click a key|Opens the link in the same tab.|
|**Alt + \<Key\>**, or **Ctrl + click**, or middle click|**⌥ + \<Key\>**, or **⌘ + click**, or middle click|Opens the link in a new tab in the background.|
|**Alt + Shift + \<Key\>** or **Ctrl + Shift + click**, or **Shift + middle click**|**⌥ + ⇧ + \<Key\>** or **⌘ + ⇧ + click**, or **Shift + middle click**|Open the link in a new tab and switches to the newly opened tab.|
|**Shift + \<Key\>**, or **Shift + click**|**⇧ + \<Key\>**, or **⇧ + click**|Opens the link in a new window.|

## Tips
* The cursor always starts from URL bar for every new tab due to the limit of browser. Press \<Tab\> or click the page to focus on the page if you want to use the shortcuts after opening a new tab.
